            <h1>Mercury!</h1>
            <div class="text">Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and never
                exceeds 28° away from the Sun. When viewed from Earth, this proximity to the Sun means the planet can
                only be seen near the western or eastern horizon during the early evening or early morning. At this
                time it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus.
                The
                planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves
                in its
                inner orbit relative to Earth, which reoccurs over the so-called synodic period approximately every 116
                days.</br></br>Mercury is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, and rotates in
                a way that is unique in the Solar System. As seen relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis
                exactly
                three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame
                of reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian
                years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.</br></br>Mercury's
                axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about ​1⁄30 degree). Its orbital
                eccentricity
                is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System; at perihelion, Mercury's distance from the Sun
                is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's surface appears heavily
                cratered
                and is similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for
                billions
                of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally
                more
                than on any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K
                (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions. The polar regions are constantly below
                180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F). The planet has no known natural satellites.</br></br>Two spacecraft have
                visited
                Mercury: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975; and MESSENGER, launched in 2004, orbited Mercury over
                4,000 times
                in four years before exhausting its fuel and crashing into the planet's surface on April 30,
                2015. The BepiColombo spacecraft will arrive at Mercury in 2025.</div>
